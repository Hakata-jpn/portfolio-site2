#### About me.

I'm a UX/UI designer with 2+ years of experience in wireframing websites and digital strategy for eCommerce and non-profit organizations. My passion is putting people first, whether you're running a $100m+ business or a local volunteering group. Though I love a good design program, my best friends are a pen and paper for sketching wireframes and user flows.

When I'm not working, you can find me rock climbing or [shooting film photos around the city](https://www.instagram.com/blanding_photog/). At home, I'm probably building a keyboard or playing some Dungeons and Dragons with friends.
