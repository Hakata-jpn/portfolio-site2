#### Who is Ren, anyways?

I'm a UX/UI and Freelance Web & Product Designer based out of Chicago, Illinois. My passions are layout design and user research that puts people's needs first. I mostly work within Figma and the Adobe Creative Cloud, which I've tutored designers on since 2015 and I'm always hungry to learn more! Though I love a good design program, my best friends are actually a pen and paper for sketching wireframes and user flows.

When I'm not working, you can find me rock climbing at the gym or doing film photos around the city. At home, I'm probably building a keyboard or playing some Dungeons and Dragons with friends.
