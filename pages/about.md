#### Who is Ren, anyways?

I'm a UX/UI and Freelance Product Designer based out of Sacramento, California. My passions are layout design and user research that put the user's needs first. I mostly work within Figma and the Adobe Creative Cloud, which I've tutored designers on since 2015 and I'm always hungry to learn more! Though I love a good design program, my best friends are actually a pen and paper for sketching wireframes and user flows.

When I'm not working, you can find me in the mountains either skiing or rock climbing. If you catch me at home, I'm probably building a keyboard or playing some Dungeons and Dragons with friends.
