### Skills Used
  - Adobe Illustrator/Photoshop
  - Blender
  - User Surveys/Research
  - Social Media Marketing (Reddit, Instagram)

### Overview

KAM Soaring Skies is a year-long project designing mechanical keyboard parts for sale across international vendors in a Kickstarter-esque group buy format.

### What I learned

- How to work with e-commerce vendors and consumers both locally and abroad
- Designing products with ease of use for keyboard hobbyists with non-standard/international key layouts
- Incorporation of user research, surveying, and online critique to improve the end product
- How to render 3D prototypes with Blender

### In Depth

Last December after the developement of [SnackIndex](/projects/snackindex/), I was coming down from having my full schedule disappear from me overnight, and I'd always wanted to make a design for one of my favorite hobbies: the custom mechanical keyboard community. Initially this set required a lot of drafting to identify the style and type of keycaps I wanted, and there were a lot of drafts and revisions:

The community's feedback was also critical in this project, and I employed 2 rounds of user surveys to get feedback and ensure that my project was kitted for as many users as possible. When creating the Interest Check, my user survey had a few goals:

#### User Survey Goals:
 - Are all of the keycap kits properly kitted for users? Are my Japanese keycap kits properly fitted for Japanese hobbyists?
 - What artisans would the community like for me to collaborate with?
 - Gain insight from the community to see what design suggestions they have.
 - Gauge popularity for my project, and the odds of success if it went to group buy.

#### User Survey Questions:
1. Where did you find this post? (Social Media Platform)
2. Which keycap kits would you be interested in buying?
3. Are there any collaborations you would like to see for KAM Soaring Skies?
4. What suggestions do you have for the kit? Any changes you would like to see? (Ex: Different sublegends, changes to kitting)
5. Anything else?

#### Findings:
- While not many users showed initial interest, those who did expressed great support. I received 66 reponses, though more popular sets tend to get around 100+.
- My kitting had a lot of initial errors, and users wanted more sets. This sparked a change from 13 to 21 total kits available for purchase.
- The suggestion from the community to make this keycap set implement glossy keycaps ended up being the strongest selling point for the keycaps when they went on sale. This change alone was the largest contributor to the success in selling my keycap set.

When I started, I didn't know how to render my keyboard project in 3D, which is a necessity in the hobby. Being a student at the outset of the project, commissioning a 3D artist was not in my budget so I resolved to learn the process from start to finish in the span of a week. The renders were possible thanks to a community tool for Blender, and [renders can be seen here!](https://imgur.com/a/TjAP57r). But even better than the renders are the end products themselves... are samples from the factory! Still in progress but I hope to get these soon.

Eventually, I had found a vendor in Vala Supply. They are an Oregon-based keyboard store that was more than happy to help make my set a reality, but we needed global reach to get this sale done. I got into touch with several different vendors from around the world, as well as the intended manufacturer of KAM Soaring Skies: Keyreative/zFrontier. Through their help, we were able to organize the sale and get it running. The group buy ended in November and has reached a minimum order quantity of 185.86% after extra kits were purchased by vendors, and will be produced with an estimated arrival of Q3 2022 for end consumers!
