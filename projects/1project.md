### Overview

KAM Soaring Skies is a year-long project designing mechanical keyboard parts for sale across international vendors in a Kickstarter-esque group buy format.

### What this project taught me

- How to work with e-commerce vendors and consumers both locally and abroad
- Designing products with ease of use for keyboard hobbyists with non-standard/international key layouts
- Incorporation of user research, surveying, and online critique to improve the end product
- How to render 3D prototypes with Blender
- Handling sales of a product, and course correction when a product launches with an error

### In Depth

Last December after the developement of [SnackIndex](#), I was coming down from having my full schedule disappear from me overnight, and I'd always wanted to make a design for one of my favorite hobbies: the custom mechanical keyboard community.

This project had a lot of initial obstacles that needed to be overcome in order for me to be able to sell it. I didn't know many vendors who could I could pitch this project to, and had no idea how to render my keyboard project in 3D, which is a necessity in the hobby. Being a student at the outset of the project, commissioning a 3D artist was not in my budget so I resolved to learn the process from start to finish in the span of a week. The renders were possible thanks to a community tool for Blender, and [renders can be seen here!](https://imgur.com/a/TjAP57r)

From there, I had to compile years of community research into my project to identify how people purchase configurations of keycaps to outfit their mechanical keyboards into my own keycap set, with the majority of my project time spent in this capacity. I spent an entire month trying to make my keycap set compatible with the 40% size keyboard community's keyboards, a hellscape of non-standard boards that lack a number row (yes, people type like this, including me right now!). Needing deeper understanding of the community needs, I employed surveys to the community to get a better sense of how to adjust my designs, and I often spent time in online discord communities getting more specific feedback for my set.

After reaching out to a friend I had made in the design process, I finally had a vendor in Vala Supply. They are an Oregon-based keyboard store that was more than happy to help make my set a reality. But we needed global reach to get this sale done. I got into touch with several different vendors from around the world, as well as the intended manufacturer of KAM Soaring Skies: Keyreative/zFrontier. Through their help, we were able to organize the sale and get it running. Currently, my set is in Group Buy until November 30th.
