### Overview

SnackIndex is a snack sharing application concept developed and researched as a solo senior project. The focus of the application was to develop a method for curious foodies to overcome obstacles to trying new foods from other parts of the world where they might not be comfortable with allergies/dietary restrictions or a language barrier.

### What I learned
- How to design mobile app prototypes from starting with sketches to finishing animations on the computer
- UX Animations using Adobe After Effects
- How to create reports for a project during the design process
- Dealing with crunch over a long period of time and burnout management
