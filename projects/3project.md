### Overview

SnackIndex is a snack sharing application concept researched, developed, and prototyped as a solo senior project. The focus of the application was to develop a method for curious foodies to overcome obstacles to trying new foods from other parts of the world where they might not be comfortable with allergies/dietary restrictions or a language barrier.

### What I learned
- How to design mobile app prototypes from starting to finish
- UX Animations using Adobe After Effects
- Documentation for a project during the design process
- Dealing with crunch over a long period of time and burnout management

The initial scope of this project saw the development of a full application via React Native, though due to scheduling conflicts we disbanded the team and proceeded as a solo design venture. [There isn't a whole lot left of that project but you can see the repo here](https://github.com/rpremi12/SnackIndex/tree/main), and a screenshot of the end result below.

After the change was made, I proceeded forward with the senior project alone. Having already started some of the background planning and research for this application in preparation for developing it in React Native, I was able to flesh the concept of SnackIndex to be more conceptually explored as prototype and not a full product. With that, I was able to develop more user flows and flesh out the user interactions with the app. You can really see how the design philosophy changed from developing each screen as we went along to fleshing out the whole system in its entirety once there was no worry about sharing design time with development efforts.

The final user flow looks like this:

you can see how that user flow is echoed in the updated medium fidelity wireframe:

With the project planning that was established for the prototype, I decided to focus on the branding last. Knowing how time-intensive that could be, I wanted to focus very specifically on the UI and brand aesthetic last. But admittedly, it's also because I was hoping that I'd be inspired by something before crunch time. Which led to SnackIndex. SnackIndex being an application inspired by my passion for snacks led to the aesthetic direction being led by a similar food item. Initially it was Konpeitou, but I stuck with Castella bread, which is a Portuguese dessert that was brought back to Japan hundreds of years ago. The global identity of the food matched my global vision for the project, and stuck.

In the meantime, I was user testing. Not only to get usability feedback from users, but to ask if people liked the branding. Over the course of several remote user testing sessions, I was able to get the feedback necessary to complete the wireframes and prototype, which you can see above.
