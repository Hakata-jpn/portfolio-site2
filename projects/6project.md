### Overview

Rydr was a ridesharing application that intended to centralize efforts to coordinate ride sharing within Cal Poly SLO, with potential to expand further beyond the local area.


### What I learned

- How to present prototypes to an audience
- How to teach people to use Figma
- Creating and user flows into a wireframe under a time crunch

### In Depth

This was a collaborative project in which our team created Rydr even after having our developers dropped out, and we were a designer short. One of our team members had no experience, and I focused a lot of my time on teaching them how to use Figma so we could get a prototype out in time for judging (they did great ðŸ˜Š).
