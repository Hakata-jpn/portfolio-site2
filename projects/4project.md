### Overview

The IKEA Store Navigator is an Augmented Reality (AR) Application that helps users navigate its retail stores. The goal of our team's application was to solve the issues with users getting lost in stores and using pencil/paper methods to purchase or find items they would like to purchase. This would be solved with a pair of AR Glasses that would help customers find their way through the store while shopping, as well as when they are trying to navigate through the furniture at the warehouse near the end of their trip. Due to the particular challenges of working with AR, special concerns were researched and addressed to make sure the application was feasible in a real-world setting.

While brainstorming for retailers who could have their customer experience (CX) improved by Augmented Reality, we began to wonder: "Could we prevent customers at IKEA from ever getting lost again"?. For this, we planned out our project to solve this pathfinding issue over the span of ten weeks:

- **Week 1:** Brainstorm and develop initial product concept
- **Week 2:** Draft abstract and define the audience for the product
- **Week 3:** Competitive analysis and interview planning for user research
- **Week 4:** User Interviews and documentation for creating user personas
- **Week 5:** Create user story with common user scenario and initial UI sketches
- **Week 6:** Wireframing for key path scenarios and validation scenarios, as well as usability analysis testing
- **Week 7:** Analysis of usability test results and wireframe adjustments, complete high fidelity wireframe
- **Week 8:** Review feedback of high fidelity wireframes, identify ethical concerns with product
- **Week 9:** Explain the technological advancements the application is reliant on, future design improvements
- **Week 10:** Brief summary of design elements implemented in application design, finalize screens and report

Our workload was egalitarian in nature, and we split tasks on a weekly basis between a total of three members of varying experience. My specific contributions involved the original concept, storyboarding, low fidelity wireframing, and occasional assistance with the direction of our report when teammates were unsure of how to proceed.
 
#### Week 1: Brainstorm/Initial Concept

As anyone who's shopped at IKEA knows, the labyrinthian layout is an iconic part of the shopping experience. But this issue can often extend into purchasing furniture, since the process is done by either taking pictures of tags for large items or writing them down on a piece of paper and finding them at the very end of the shopping trip where there's a secondary maze to find your large items. Our concept was to be a dual purpose app that would help you find your way through the store throughout the entire shopping process to streamline the CX, employing arrows through AR glasses to help you find your way.

Here's an screen to demonstrate the concept:

#### Week 2: Abstract and audience identification

With these concepts in mind, we further elaborated our intentions for the application through our abstract. In this phase, we also made sure to identify our end users that we intended to target with the solutions we had planned out. One area that was missed until much further along in the design process was the usefulness of this AR platform for accessibility purposes, since the distracting nature of the layout could lead to confusion for customers with struggle with visual cues. But in our initial scope, our target was anyone interested in the purchase of IKEA furniture, and that would suffice for the meantime.

#### Week 3: Competitive analysis and interview planning

In the landscape of navigation applications, we were aware of google maps but found the competitive landscape to be fairly minimal. There are glasses used for navigation but usually in cases of road navigation in a larger scale. For example, the Solos Smartglasses are meant for cyclists to be able to navigate themselves, but suffer from short battery life (common in AR headsets without a separate battery unit). Lowe's Innovation Labs in the early '10s attempted to solve the problem but never took off, as well as Google Maps having some AR navigation features that were never fully planned out.

As for interview planning, we prepared our questions in order to find pain points for IKEA customers, as well as identify their comfort level with AR and navigation technology. More questions are included in the document but for the sake of brevity, here are two questions that were pivotal to our research:

- *Have you ever shopped at an Ikea? What is the experience of shopping there like, and what are the steps you take to complete a purchase there?*
- *Have you ever heard of/used an Augmented Reality Headset? If so, what are your thoughts on this technology?*

#### Week 4: User interviews and user persona creation

With each project member hosting at least two different interviews, we were able to gather the feedback and create a user persona:

- **Susan Cooper, a 32 year old training manager for a financial company who has recently moved to the Bay Area.**
Due to her busy job, she struggles to find time to get all of the furniture she needs for her new home. While not familiar with AR technology, she is open-minded and comfortable using navigation services on her phone. She doesn't use the store's pen and paper method of buying large items and takes pictures with her phone to remember what she wants at the end of her trip, though she finds that method to be disorganized.

> "I feel lost whenever I go into IKEA. I wish there was a way to navigate quickly through the store without distractions, so I could get on with my busy day." - Susan Cooper

With these insights, we decided to focus on *giving her the means to acquire the furniture she wanted to buy, speed up the shopping experience at the IKEA warehouse, and get her assistance on demand*, especially if a human element can expedite the process.

#### Week 5: Common user scenario and initial UI sketches

With the personas made, we crafted a common user scenario alongside how users would identify and resolve previous areas of friction in their shopping experience. While formatted for PDF, an example sketch is here: (Please be kind, my drawing skills are lacking!)

One of my partners then led the initial sketches for wireframing, which I followed up with the initial Figma wireframes.

#### Week 6: Key path and validation scenarios + Usability testing

Once the initial wireframes were done, we tested them with four of our previous interview subjects with questions regarding our three use cases:
- Scan furniture to search for it later
- Call for human assistance
- Navigate themselves through the store with the instructions given

#### Week 7: Analysis of usability test results + High fidelity wireframes

After proctoring our remote usability testing sessions, the majority of the feedback was at the UI level. The interface was considered pretty intuitive (as much as wireframes could be without navigational context), but the status of the application as well as the buttons were not the most clear. With that feedback, we developed the high fidelity wireframes using the IKEA branding and a larger/more clear UI. While we were unable to procure a style guide, it was important to match their friendly and outward facing style in our application, and we tried to reflect that as best as one can in AR.

#### Week 8: Feedback review and ethical concerns with product

At this stage, we sent out our application and report for review. In the meantime, it became incredibly important to consider the ethical implications of our device before we concluded with the project, and how to account for those issues. With the prospects of users carrying a camera around them at all times, privacy would need to be adjusted for areas of the store where it would be critical to maintain (such as a restroom). Ensuring that the camera is only on when scanning QR codes was critical to ensure that no recording would be done in unauthorized locations. The device could then notify the user that the camera is disabled.

Another issue to consider were the balances between visibility and clarity for users. Because clarity of the UI was important, we wanted to make sure that the elements of the app followed proper color contrast and size guidelines for accessibility purposes. However, we also implemented light forms of transparency to balance the visibility of the app with the ability for users to see their surroundings and not get injured while walking around. Due to current AR technology, a lot of buttons on an AR device are small, and it would be advisable to make a proprietary headset to allow those with physical disabilities to use the same buttons as more able-bodied users.

#### Week 9: Technological dependencies and future design improvements

While the technologies present in early 2021 were not available to properly implement this, we believed the app to be a feasible service for IKEA if a headset were developed with the following features:
- Lightweight single consumer unit
- 4 buttons and a single camera for QR code scanning
- Battery life of 5 hours
- A form of wireless connection with triangulation with wireless transmitters for store navigation

Most of the innovations we were able to find with AR were more focused for industrial applications and were more bulky than our customers could handle. As well as technical constraints, there were a number of enhancements we had planned for future iterations. One of the more critical functions was a map of the entire store, as well as markers to indicate important areas of the store (such as a restroom, exits, or the restaurant). Future implementations could also further improve accessibility by allowing for the use of text-to-speech for those who are hard of hearing, or a secondary remote for use with customers who struggle to use the buttons on a small headset.

#### Week 10: Design elements implemented in application design + final report

There were many aspects of the design that were important to us, so I will name two that guided the design process:

 **Flexibility-Usability Tradeoff**
 While there was a high need to accommodate for a wide variety of users, we wanted to ensure that the interface would not be too cluttered of overwhelming. There was a maximum of only 3-4 elements on the screen at any given time. As well as that, while the headset does tell users where they are in the store and where to go next, the navigational arrows only work for the warehouse section of the store to make the system more straightforward.

**Signal-to-noise ratio**
Because of the simplicity of the application, the user is allowed to make the shopping experience the focus of their time at Ikea. The buttons are all out of the way to ensure that the view is not obstructed, and all of the functions are rounded down and simplified. Even if a user needs assistance, rather than making the application handle the process, it will send for an employee to assist. With minimal text and complication
the signal remains strong throughout the design.
