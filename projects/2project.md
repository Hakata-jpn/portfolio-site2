### In Depth

When I was hired at [Murphy's Magic](https://www.murphysmagic.com/) to help them renovate their website and guide the strategy for their e-commerce business going forward, it was incredibly daunting. This was my first industry job and a monumental task for a team, much less a single person. However, I was able to get pointed in the right direction with the help of my supervisor getting me interviews with people in the industry. From there I was able to better understand the history and context behind the magic wholesaler that helped shape the future direction for renovating their website.
